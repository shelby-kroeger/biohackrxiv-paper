abstract = {{PURPOSE}: The study aim to identify novel molecular subtypes of ovarian cancer by gene expression profiling with linkage to clinical and pathologic features. {EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: Microarray gene expression profiling was done on 285 serous and endometrioid tumors of the ovary, peritoneum, and fallopian tube. K-means clustering was applied to identify robust molecular subtypes. Statistical analysis identified differentially expressed genes, pathways, and gene ontologies. Laser capture microdissection, pathology review, and immunohistochemistry validated the array-based findings. Patient survival within k-means groups was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. Class prediction validated k-means groups in an independent dataset. A semisupervised survival analysis of the array data was used to compare against unsupervised clustering results. {RESULTS}: Optimal clustering of array data identified six molecular subtypes. Two subtypes represented predominantly serous low malignant potential and low-grade endometrioid subtypes, respectively. The remaining four subtypes represented higher grade and advanced stage cancers of serous and endometrioid morphology. A novel subtype of high-grade serous cancers reflected a mesenchymal cell type, characterized by overexpression of N-cadherin and P-cadherin and low expression of differentiation markers, including {CA125} and {MUC1}. A poor prognosis subtype was defined by a reactive stroma gene expression signature, correlating with extensive desmoplasia in such samples. A similar poor prognosis signature could be found using a semisupervised analysis. Each subtype displayed distinct levels and patterns of immune cell infiltration. Class prediction identified similar subtypes in an independent ovarian dataset with similar prognostic trends. {CONCLUSION}: Gene expression profiling identified molecular subtypes of ovarian cancer of biological and clinical importance.}

abstract = {Colorectal cancer ({CRC}) is a frequently lethal disease with heterogeneous outcomes and drug responses. To resolve inconsistencies among the reported gene expression-based {CRC} classifications and facilitate clinical translation, we formed an international consortium dedicated to large-scale data sharing and analytics across expert groups. We show marked interconnectivity between six independent classification systems coalescing into four consensus molecular subtypes ({CMSs}) with distinguishing features: {CMS1} (microsatellite instability immune, 14\%), hypermutated, microsatellite unstable and strong immune activation; {CMS2} (canonical, 37\%), epithelial, marked {WNT} and {MYC} signaling activation; {CMS3} (metabolic, 13\%), epithelial and evident metabolic dysregulation; and {CMS4} (mesenchymal, 23\%), prominent transforming growth factor-\beta activation, stromal invasion and angiogenesis. Samples with mixed features (13\%) possibly represent a transition phenotype or intratumoral heterogeneity. We consider the {CMS} groups the most robust classification system currently available for {CRC}-with clear biological interpretability-and the basis for future clinical stratification and subtype-based targeted interventions.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Cheminformaticians are equipped with a very rich toolbox when carrying out molecular similarity calculations. A large number of molecular representations exist, and there are several methods (similarity and distance metrics) to quantify the similarity of molecular representations. In this work, eight well-known similarity/distance metrics are compared on a large dataset of molecular fingerprints with sum of ranking differences ({SRD}) and {ANOVA} analysis. The effects of molecular size, selection methods and data pretreatment methods on the outcome of the comparison are also assessed. {RESULTS}: A supplier database (https://mcule.com/) was used as the source of compounds for the similarity calculations in this study. A large number of datasets, each consisting of one hundred compounds, were compiled, molecular fingerprints were generated and similarity values between a randomly chosen reference compound and the rest were calculated for each dataset. Similarity metrics were compared based on their ranking of the compounds within one experiment (one dataset) using sum of ranking differences ({SRD}), while the results of the entire set of experiments were summarized on box and whisker plots. Finally, the effects of various factors (data pretreatment, molecule size, selection method) were evaluated with analysis of variance ({ANOVA}). {CONCLUSIONS}: This study complements previous efforts to examine and rank various metrics for molecular similarity calculations. Here, however, an entirely general approach was taken to neglect any a priori knowledge on the compounds involved, as well as any bias introduced by examining only one or a few specific scenarios. The Tanimoto index, Dice index, Cosine coefficient and Soergel distance were identified to be the best (and in some sense equivalent) metrics for similarity calculations, i.e. these metrics could produce the rankings closest to the composite (average) ranking of the eight metrics. The similarity metrics derived from Euclidean and Manhattan distances are not recommended on their own, although their variability and diversity from other similarity metrics might be advantageous in certain cases (e.g. for data fusion). Conclusions are also drawn regarding the effects of molecule size, selection method and data pretreatment on the ranking behavior of the studied metrics.

Here, we report more than a 1,000-fold scale-up of the {CMap} as part of the {NIH} {LINCS} Consortium, made possible by a new, low-cost, high-throughput reduced representation expression profiling method that we term L1000. We show that L1000 is highly reproducible, comparable to {RNA} sequencing, and suitable for computational inference of the expression levels of 81\% of non-measured transcripts. We further show that the expanded {CMap} can be used to discover mechanism of action of small molecules, functionally annotate genetic variants of disease genes, and inform clinical trials.

abstract = {Small cell lung cancer ({SCLC}) is an exceptionally lethal malignancy for which more effective therapies are urgently needed. Several lines of evidence, from {SCLC} primary human tumours, patient-derived xenografts, cancer cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models, appear to be converging on a new model of {SCLC} subtypes defined by differential expression of four key transcription regulators: achaete-scute homologue 1 ({ASCL1}; also known as {ASH1}), neurogenic differentiation factor 1 ({NeuroD1}), yes-associated protein 1 ({YAP1}) and {POU} class 2 homeobox 3 ({POU2F3}). In this Perspectives article, we review and synthesize these recent lines of evidence and propose a working nomenclature for {SCLC} subtypes defined by relative expression of these four factors. Defining the unique therapeutic vulnerabilities of these subtypes of {SCLC} should help to focus and accelerate therapeutic research, leading to rationally targeted approaches that may ultimately improve clinical outcomes for patients with this disease.}

abstract = {{PURPOSE} {OF} {REVIEW}: Recent whole genome characterizations of primary human bladder cancers revealed that they can be grouped into "intrinsic" basal and luminal molecular subtypes. Here, we provide an overview of the subtypes and discuss their biological and clinical properties. {RECENT} {FINDINGS}: Basal cancers are characterized by advanced stage and metastatic disease at presentation. They tend to be enriched with squamous and small cell/neuroendocrine features and inactivating mutations and deletions of {TP53} and {RB1}. Basal cancers can be divided into "epithelial" and "mesenchymal" (also known as "claudin low") subsets, and a portion of the latter form a "neuroendocrine/neuronal" subset that is associated with particularly poor survival. Luminal cancers are often enriched with papillary histopathological features and activating mutations in {FGFR3}, and they can also be divided into additional subsets based on differential stromal cell infiltration, relative genomic instability, and high- versus low-level expression of carcinoma in situ ({CIS}) gene expression signatures. Importantly, the bladder cancer molecular subtypes display differential sensitivities to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade, and preliminary data also suggest that they respond differently to radiation with or without hypoxia modulation. Ongoing studies are investigating the relevance of the molecular subtypes to the bladder cancer histopathological variants and to upper tract urothelial cancer. The bladder cancer molecular subtypes were associated with different prognoses and responses to conventional and targeted therapies in retrospective studies. If validated in prospective studies, molecular subtyping will be integrated into bladder cancer clinical management.}

abstract = {Defining the cellular response to pharmacological agents is critical for understanding the mechanism of action of small molecule perturbagens. Here, we developed a 96-well-plate-based high-throughput screening infrastructure for quantitative proteomics and profiled 875 compounds in a human cancer cell line with near-comprehensive proteome coverage. Examining the 24-h proteome changes revealed ligand-induced changes in protein expression and uncovered rules by which compounds regulate their protein targets while identifying putative dihydrofolate reductase and tankyrase inhibitors. We used protein-protein and compound-compound correlation networks to uncover mechanisms of action for several compounds, including the adrenergic receptor antagonist {JP1302}, which we show disrupts the {FACT} complex and degrades histone H1. By profiling many compounds with overlapping targets covering a broad chemical space, we linked compound structure to mechanisms of action and highlighted off-target polypharmacology for molecules within the library. \copyright 2023.
